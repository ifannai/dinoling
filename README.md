# Dino Party Invites

A tiny HTML/JS activity where a dinosaur walks left/right to invite mushrooms to a Saturday party. Students choose or type refusal responses; kind refusals refill hearts while blunt ones break them.

## Run locally
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (double-click or use a simple static server).
2. Use the ◀ ▶ arrow keys to walk; mushrooms wait ahead on the path.
3. When you bump into a mushroom, a speech bubble shows Dino's invite; choose/type a refusal so the mushroom can reply (their answer floats above them).
4. After answering, press ↑ to jump over and continue. Dino can't pass a mushroom until it replies.

No build steps are required.
